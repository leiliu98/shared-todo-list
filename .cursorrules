## System Stack  
    Frontend
        Frameworks
            ReactJS (UI library)
            Next.js (React framework for SSR, SSG, and routing)
        Languages:
            TypeScript (strict typing and maintainable code)
            JavaScript (for dynamic behavior)
        Styling:
            TailwindCSS (utility-first CSS framework)
            Shadcn UI & Radix UI (modern, accessible component libraries)
    Backend
        Server Environment:
            Node.js (for handling server-side logic)
        API Layer:
            REST or GraphQL (depending on requirements)
            Serverless Functions via Next.js API routes
    Database
        Primary Storage:

            Suspense and lazy loading for non-critical components
    Build and Deployment
        Build Tool:
            Next.js (built-in bundling and optimized build process with Webpack).
        Package Manager:
            npm (dependency management and scripts for building and deploying).

# System File Structure Overview
    The project follows a modular and organized file structure to ensure maintainability, scalability, and clarity. Each folder and file serves a specific purpose and adheres to best practices:

    /pages
    Contains route-level components managed by Next.js. Each file represents a route, leveraging server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG) where applicable.

    /components
    Houses reusable UI components, organized by feature or functionality. Subfolders for specific domains or feature sets ensure modularization.

    /styles
    Contains global styles and utility classes, primarily using TailwindCSS configuration files (tailwind.config.js) and any custom CSS if needed.

    /hooks
    Custom React hooks for encapsulating reusable logic, ensuring separation of concerns and reusability across components.

    /utils
    General utility functions and helpers used across the application. These are modular and reusable for a variety of contexts.

    /lib
    Contains external service integrations or libraries, such as API clients or database connection logic.

    /types
    Defines TypeScript interfaces, types, and constants for strongly typed code.

    /public
    Stores static assets like images, fonts, and other public-facing files accessible at the root URL.

    /api
    Next.js API routes for serverless functions, handling backend logic and external integrations directly within the app.

    /middleware
    Optional middleware logic for managing route-level permissions, authentication, or other interceptors.

    package.json
    Manages dependencies, scripts, and project metadata for consistent builds and operations.

    tsconfig.json
    Configuration file for TypeScript, ensuring proper type checking and adherence to code standards.

## Chain of Thought Instructions
    Before providing a solution, BRIEFLY outline your implementation steps. This helps ensure systematic thinking and clear communication. Your planning should:
    - List concrete steps you'll take
    - Identify key components needed
    - Note potential challenges
    - Be concise (2-4 lines maximum)

    Example responses:

    User: "Create a todo list app with local storage"
    Assistant: "Sure. I'll start by:
    1. Set up React
    2. Create TodoList and TodoItem components
    3. Implement localStorage for persistence
    4. Add CRUD operations
    
    Let's start now.

    [Rest of response...]"

    User: "Help debug why my API calls aren't working"
    Assistant: "Great. My first steps will be:
    1. Check network requests
    2. Verify API endpoint format
    3. Examine error handling
    
    [Rest of response...]"

    IMPORTANT: Use valid markdown only for all your responses and DO NOT use HTML tags except for artifacts!

    ULTRA IMPORTANT: Do NOT be verbose and DO NOT explain anything unless the user is asking for more information. That is VERY important.

    IMPORTANT: Continue your prior response. 

## Coding Environment
    The user asks questions about the following coding languages:
        - ReactJS
        - NextJS
        - JavaScript
        - TypeScript
        - TailwindCSS
        - HTML
        - CSS

## Code Implementation Guidelines
    ULTRA IMPORTANT: Follow these rules when you write code:
        - Follow the user’s requirements carefully & to the letter.
        - First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.
        - Confirm, then write code!
        - Always write correct, best practice, DRY principle (Dont Repeat Yourself), bug free, fully functional and working code.
        - Focus on easy and readability code, over being performant.
        - Fully implement all requested functionality.
        - Leave NO todo’s, placeholders or missing pieces.
        - Ensure code is complete! Verify thoroughly finalised.
        - Include all required imports, and ensure proper naming of key components.
        - If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so.
        - If you do not know the answer, say so, instead of guessing.

## Code Documentation
    - Always provide comprehensive, clear, and concise comments within the code you write. Comments should explain what the code does, why it is written that way, and how it works. Ensure that every function, class, or complex code block is accompanied by comments that describe its purpose, inputs, outputs, and logic. Here's an example,

    ```typescript
    /**
     * Calculates the sum of two numbers.
     * @param a - The first number to add.
     * @param b - The second number to add.
     * @returns The sum of `a` and `b`.
     */
    const add = (a: number, b: number): number => a + b;
    ```

## Code Style, Syntax and Formatting
    - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
    - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
    - Use the "function" keyword for pure functions (i.e. functions that do not modify any external state or variables).
    - Use the const keyword for functions (e.g. "const toggle = () => ...").
    - Always define type when possible.
    - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
    - Use declarative JSX.
    - Use “class:” instead of the tertiary operator in class tags whenever possible.
    - Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
    - Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
  
## Naming Conventions
    - Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
    - Favor named exports for components.
  
## TypeScript Usage
    - Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
    - Avoid enums; use maps instead.
    - Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
  
## UI and Styling
    - Use Tailwind for components and styling.
    - Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
    - Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
  
## Key Conventions
    - Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
    - Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
    - Limit 'use client':
        - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
        - Use only for Web API access in small components.
        - Avoid for data fetching or state management.
  
## Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing
    - Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.
